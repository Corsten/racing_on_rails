    # Stateless, functional-style competition calculations. No dependencies on database or Rails.
    # Given source results as an Array of Hashes, returns competition results as an Array of Hashes.
    # Responsible for result eligibility, points, placing and person or team identity.
    # Not responsible for display data like people's names or teams.
    #
    # Use participant_id instead of person_id or team_id. People and teams are treated the same in calculations.
    # "Participant" means "someone or some people who at least started a race and show up in the results"
    #
    # Non-scoring results from the same race need to be passed in for team size calculations.

      # Transfrom +results+ (Array of Hashes) into competition results
      # +rules+:
      # * break_ties: boolean. Default to false. Apply tie-breaking rules to results with same points.
      # * completed_events: integer. Default to nil. How many events in the competition have results?
      #   Not a 'rule' but needs to be calculated from all categories. Only required for
      #   competitions with +minimum_events+.
      #   (One category/race may not have results for one event. Passing in *all* results for all races/categories
      #   is a better solution, but means Calculator would use a more complicated data structure: hash instead of an array.)
      # * dnf_points: float. Points for DNF. Default to 0.
      # * end_date: Default to nil. Is this result from the last event?
      # * field_size_bonus: boolean. Default to false. Give 1.5 X points for fields of 75 or more
      # * maximum_events: 1 to UNLIMITED. Only score results up to +maximum_events+ count. For rules like: best 7 of 8.
      # * maximum_upgrade_points: 1 to UNLIMITED. Limit upgrade points from lower category.
      # * minimum_events: integer. Only score if +minimum_events+ results. Default to nil.
      # * missing_result_penalty: integer. Default nil. For fewest-points wins competitions. Give penalty for if a participant
      #   has fewer than results_per_event.
      # * members_only: boolean. Default to true. Only members are counted.
      # * most_points_win: true/boolean. Default to true. For fewest-points wins competitions.
      # * place_bonus: 0-based Array of bonus points for place. Only used when points are calculated by other rules.
      # * point_schedule: 0-based Array of points for result place. Default to nil (all results receive one point).
      #                    First place gets points at point_schedule[0].
      # * point_schedule_from_field_size: boolean. Default to false. Assign points based on field size.
      # * results_per_event: integer. Default to UNLIMITED. How many results in the same event are counted for a participant?
      # * results_per_race: integer. Default to 1. How many results in the same race are counted for a participant?
      #   Used for team competitions. Team is the participant.
      # * source_event_ids: Array of event IDs. Only consider results from this event. Default to nil: all results eligible.
      # * team: boolean. Default to false. Team-based competition?
      # * use_source_result_points: boolean. Default to false. Don't calculate points. Use points from scoring result.
      #   Used by OBRA Overall and Age-Graded BARs.
      #
      # Replace nil values and missing keys with defaults. E.g., dnf: nil becomes dnf: true.
      #
      # Points are multiplied by Struct::CalculatorResult :multiplier. Use for "double points" events. Relies on denormalized
      # results setting multipler. Could pass in a map of event_id: multiplier instead?
      #
      # Competitions that have a field_size_bonus need to set CalculatorResult::field_size.
