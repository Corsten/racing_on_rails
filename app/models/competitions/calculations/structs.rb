      # Use simple datatypes with no behavior. Hash doesn't have method-like accessors, which means we
      # can't use symbol to proc. E.g., results.sort_by(&:points). OpenStruct is slow. Full-blown classes
      # are overkill. Could add methods to Struct using doâ€¦end, ActiveModels or maybe subclass Hash but Struct
      # works well.
      #
      # Struct::Result would clash with Active Record models so Structs are prefixed with "Calculator."
      # Source result or calculated competition result.
      # +tied+ is plumbing set during calculation. If place method can't break a tie, results are marked as "tied" so they
      # are given the same points.
      #
      # +team_size+ is calculated here, too, though it could be passed in.
